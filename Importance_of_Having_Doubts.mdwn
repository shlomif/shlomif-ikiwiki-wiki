<p> Some rules of thumb I tweeted about recently: </p>

<ol>

<li> If someone tells you something is impossible and you
can't do it, it probably can be done.  </li>

<li> If someone tells you something will *surely* never
happen, it likely can happen.  </li>

<li> If someone tells you are an idiot and are definitely
wrong, then you probably uncovered an <a

in the Room</a> and are right. Also see <a

criticism and try to get offended”</a>.  </li>

</ol>

<p> In general, people who are sure of themselves are probably
wrong, as I am not even sure of the <a

Logic</a> which got us incredibly far.  </p>
