   <rindolf>  "Who's the idiot that wrote this code?"
   <rindolf>  That's what many people say when looking at their old code.
 <jkauffman>  "I can't believe I used to listen to this crap"
 <jkauffman>  that's what people say when they look back at their old
              music collection
   <rindolf>  jkauffman: I don't usually.
   <rindolf>  jkauffman: I am however, a bit ashamed of some of the shows
              I liked when I was younger.
   <rindolf>  jkauffman: they seem a bit cheesy now.
 <jkauffman>  yes, you're onto such better things now that you can fully
              appreciate The Gilmore Girls
   <rindolf>  jkauffman: you can never truly appreciate The Gilmore Girls
              until you've watched it in the original Klingon.
