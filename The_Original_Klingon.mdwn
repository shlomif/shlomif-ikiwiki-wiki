   <rindolf>  "Who's the idiot that wrote this code?"
   <rindolf>  That's what many people say when looking at their old code.
 <jkauffman>  "I can't believe I used to listen to this crap"
 <jkauffman>  that's what people say when they look back at their old
              music collection
   <rindolf>  jkauffman: I don't usually.
   <rindolf>  jkauffman: I am however, a bit ashamed of some of the shows
              I liked when I was younger.
   <rindolf>  jkauffman: they seem a bit cheesy now.
 <jkauffman>  yes, you're onto such better things now that you can fully
              appreciate The Gilmore Girls
   <rindolf>  jkauffman: you can never truly appreciate The Gilmore Girls
              until you've watched it in the original Klingon.

I've always considered myself a little "girly" and now I'm even kind-of proud of it, and am otherwise a straight male.  'You can never truly appreciate The Gilmore Girls until you've watched it in the original #Klingon! Ha ha only serious.

You can never truly appreciate Hamlet until you've read it in the original Klingon. But all the mightiest Klingon warriors have watched The Lion King instead or in addition, possibly with Klingon subtitles.

Selina: [On the phone] Hello?

Selina: Oh, hi, Jess!

Selina: In a park…

Selina: Well, it was a good day for some Klingons I met to die.

Jessica on the phone: Sel, you’re getting strange lately, but you are becoming more amusing in the process.

Selina: Tell me about it! By the way, apparently, we will never be able to
truly appreciate Sesame Street until we watch it in the original Klingon.

Jessica on the phone: [Laughing] I guess I’ll never understand.
