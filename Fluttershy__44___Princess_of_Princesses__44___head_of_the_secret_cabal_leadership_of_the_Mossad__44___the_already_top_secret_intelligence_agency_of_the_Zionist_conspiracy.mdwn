"Fluttershy, Princess of Princesses, head of the secret cabal leadership of the Mossad, the already top secret intelligence agency of the Zionist conspiracy" is a tongue-in-cheek crossover parody of some anti-Israeli/anti-"Zionist"/Jewish world domination conspiracy theories, coined by Shlomi Fish.

Here is the midrash (or study) of it explaining how it came together and the sources for it.

[Fluttershy](https://mlp.fandom.com/wiki/Fluttershy) is a character in the animated television series [My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_Little_Pony:_Friendship_Is_Magic) as created by Hasbro. Originally intended primarily for young children, especially young girls, the show has become popular among many adult and adolescent fans, both men and women, including mostly hetereosexual males and even many male combat soldiers from militaries around the world. It sparked an active culture of fan art (including fan fic, parodies, mashups and fan videos), and many of its fans can spend long amounts of time analysing and discussing it on online forums.

Anyway, Fluttershy is an adult pegasus pony and one of the 6 main characters of the show. She spends most of her time taking care of animals (those who do not talk) and while being kind and good-hearted she often goes to great lengths to satisfy the whims of her friends and those she cares about. She is also insecure, recessive, does not have magic of her own, often underestimates herself, and tends to be hurt by criticism and afraid of it. Despite all that, she is often the most effective character in the show, and has saved the day several times.

An MLP fan will find it unlikely that Fluttershy (assuming she was real) is the secret head of the mossad much less a secret sinister "Zionist" world control conspiracy.
