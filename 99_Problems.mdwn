> **rindolf**: Yes, I’m single - I’ve got 99 problems but a bitch ain’t one.

> **rindolf**: And yes, I realise that the guy who said that (Jay-Z) now has a 100th problem (a bitch) and a 101st problem (a child).

(See [“Jay-Z entry” from the Beyoncé wikipedia](http://beyonce.wikia.com/wiki/Jay_Z).)
