# The Colour of the Bikeshed / Parkinson’s Law of Triviality

[Parkinson’s Law of Triviality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkinson%27s_law_of_triviality)

<blockquote>

<p>
Why should I Care What Color the Bikeshed is?
</p>

<p>
"The really, really short answer is that you should not. The somewhat longer answer is that just because you are capable of building a bikeshed does not mean you should stop others from building one just because you do not like the color they plan to paint it. This is a metaphor indicating that you need not argue about every little feature just because you know enough to do so. Some people have commented that the amount of noise generated by a change is inversely proportional to the complexity of the change."

# Feature-creep / Featuritis

[Feature creep](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_creep)

<blockquote>

Feature creep, creeping featurism or featuritis is the ongoing expansion or addition of new features in a product, such as in computer software. Extra features go beyond the basic function of the product and so can result in software bloat and over-complication rather than simple design.

# Wil Wheaton about a Bad Review of his book

<blockquote>

<p>
Well, right now I need to examine my life, and I need to be totally honest with myself. I have to own up to something: I *did* hope that my book would get noticed by the Industry. I hoped that it would get noticed by critics, and I hoped that The Media would pay attention . . . but all that happened after it was published. When I wrote it, I hoped that my story would be amusing, interesting, and maybe even inspiring to people.
And you know what? That’s exactly what Real People tell me when they read my book: they were amused, interested, and occassionaly inspired.
</p>

<p>
What a myopic fucking fool I’ve been! What a stupid, stupid jerkass! I was so worried about impressing The Cool Kids, I forgot who I am, and why I do this. And even worse, I disrespected — even if unintentionally — the very people who have been with me on The Journey all along. It’s not some stupid magazine that owes *me* an apology; it’s *me* who owes all those Real People an apology.”
</p>

<p>
I turned to Anne. “I know what I’m going to write when we get home.”
</p>

<p>
“Good,” she said. “Just let it go.”
</p>

<p>
“I just did.”

Wil,

No need to apologize. You did nothing wrong. Everyone (who isn’t a sociopath, that is) has feelings, and they’re fragile. It’s tough to grow a thick skin.
