# The Colour of the Bikeshed / Parkinson’s Law of Triviality

<blockquote>

<p>
Why should I Care What Color the Bikeshed is?
</p>

<p>
"The really, really short answer is that you should not. The somewhat longer answer is that just because you are capable of building a bikeshed does not mean you should stop others from building one just because you do not like the color they plan to paint it. This is a metaphor indicating that you need not argue about every little feature just because you know enough to do so. Some people have commented that the amount of noise generated by a change is inversely proportional to the complexity of the change."

# Feature-creep / Featuritis

[Feature creep](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_creep)

<blockquote>

Feature creep, creeping featurism or featuritis is the ongoing expansion or addition of new features in a product, such as in computer software. Extra features go beyond the basic function of the product and so can result in software bloat and over-complication rather than simple design.
